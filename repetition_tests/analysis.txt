REPETITION TESTER
Compiled with a release profile to elide bounds/overflow checking wherever possible.
Optimized for binary size, loop vectorization disabled (-C opt-level="z")

Total bytes CPU needs to process loop: 0x00007FF6115A257D - 0x00007FF6115A2572 = 11 bytes
Best reported throughput: 3.8630gb/s -> ~3.86gb/s
My CPU frequency: 4.25 GHz
(4.25 * 1000^3) / (3.86 * 1024^3) ~=  1.025 cycles per loop iteration
So, 11 bytes in ~1.025 cycles



ANALYSIS OF WRITE ALL BYTES FUNCTIONS (NORMAL + ASM)

write all bytes rust function
best: 3.9060gb/s
1.0133 cycles per iteration

write all bytes asm function
best: 3.9050gb/s
1.0136 cycles per iteration

write all bytes asm function, mov replaced with 3-byte nop
best: 3.9544gb/s
1.0010 cycles per iteration

write all bytes asm function, mov removed entirely
best: 3.9531gb/s
1.0013 cycles per iteration

write all bytes asm function, just decrementing
best: 3.9396gb/s
1.0046 cycles per iteration

Conclusion:
Observations match Casey's findings from the "Linking Directly to ASM for Experimentation" video.
Did originally encounter some weird behavior where one of the above functions would randomly drop to
a throughput of about 1.9gb/s. For some reason forcing the TimeTestSection functions to be
#[inline(never)] fixed that issue. TimeTestSection::begin and TimeTestSection::end were previously
set to #[inline(always)], so maybe that was causing the compiler to output code in a weird manner in
some cases.

Basically, there's something about that mov instruction that's slowing us down...


NOP LOOP REP TESTS ANALYSIS
Compiled with dev profile using -C opt-level=z
For some reason using the release profile is giving weird and somewhat unexpected results even
though it's running the exact same assembly and measuring time in the exact same ways...
The only thing I noticed was that maybe the location in the binary of the test code, the timing
code, and the assembly code might have been different between the release and dev profiles...

So the front end of the CPU suddenly begins to tank after about 3 3-byte nops...
For completeness, the results of the release test are included here.
This test was compiled with opt-level=z as well.
